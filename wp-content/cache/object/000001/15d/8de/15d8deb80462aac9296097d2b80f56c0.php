These days, it&#8217;s hard to keep track of who does and doesn&#8217;t have access. In fact, some developers are getting temporary access for release cycles to work on specific features.</p>
<p>I remember in 2010, community member DD32 or Dion Hulse was <a title="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/01/13/congrats-dd32/" href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2010/01/13/congrats-dd32/">granted core commit access</a>. When Dion Hulse was hired by Automattic, the move generated discussions on whether or not it was ok for Automattic to have so many employees with core commit access versus those with no affiliation with the company. Fast forward four years later and the subject appears to have been a moot point.</p>
<p>On the last day of 2013, Andrew Nacin <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/12/31/commit-announcements-for-3-9/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/12/31/commit-announcements-for-3-9/">outlined the number of people</a> with permanent access to commit code to the core of WordPress as well as those who have received temporary access. It now takes three hands to count all of the people who have the permanent ability to commit code.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here‚Äôs a full list of those with permanent commit: <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/markjaquith/">@markjaquith</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/ryan/">@ryan</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/westi/">@westi</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/matt/">@matt</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/azaozz/">@azaozz</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/dd32/">@dd32</a>, @koopersmith, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/duck_/">@duck_</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/helen/">@helen</a>, and me (<a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/nacin/">@nacin</a>); <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/lancewillett/">@lancewillett</a> for bundled themes; <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/mentions/iammattthomas/">@iammattthomas</a> for UI.

<p>It&#8217;s great to see so many talented people involved with the core of the project. It would be awesome to see more companies like 10up find a way to <a title="http://wptavern.com/10up-sponsors-helen-hou-sandi-to-work-full-time-on-wordpress-core" href="http://wptavern.com/10up-sponsors-helen-hou-sandi-to-work-full-time-on-wordpress-core">sponsor an employee</a> to work on WordPress full-time.

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/aquarius" target="_blank">Aquarius</a> is a theme that was created to highlight blog content and as such does not include an host of confusing options for customization. It does, however, pack in all the basics one might look for in a modern WordPress blogging theme, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive and retina-ready</li>
<li>Supports all built-in post formats with basic styling</li>
<li>Two widgetized areas &#8211; sidebar and footer</li>
<li>Fixed navigation</li>
<li>Custom navigation overlay pattern</li>
<li>Clean Georgia-based typography</li>
<li>Very easy to use &#8211; no theme options</li>

<p>This is the first theme created by the <a href="http://dekciw.lt/" target="_blank">individual</a> behind <a href="http://wplovin.com/" target="_blank">wplovin.com</a>. He/she plans to expand the collection throughout 2014, as stated on the theme&#8217;s homepage: &#8220;So, I&#8217;ve challenged myself to handcraft twelve free WordPress themes in 2014. That&#8217;s one awesome theme per month.&#8221; The planned themes will be &#8220;newbie-friendly,&#8221; easy to use and will follow WordPress&#8217; standard theme development practices.

<h3>Plugins Picked By Marcus:</h3>
<p><a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-like-system/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-like-system/">WP Like System</a> is a rating system for WordPress posts, based on Facebook likes. Allow users like (and undo) your blog posts. A user‚Äôs likes are saved directly on your database, like a WordPress native component, which means users can give you a &#8220;like&#8221; without a Facebook account. This would be great to change the ‚Äúlike‚Äù term to something else, and use an alternative icon instead of the thumbs up. Overall a good plugin.</p>
<p><a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-post-preview/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-post-preview/">Responsive Post Preview</a> has functionality that I envision being a part of WordPress core someday. It allows you to preview a post as it would look on multiple devices. Choose mobile or tablet device size for your preview. This plugin makes it so much easier to format your responsive content to make certain that everything lines up the way you want it to.</p>
<p><a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-grass/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-grass/">WP Grass</a> &#8211; The grass grows higher and higher on the footer when you have not published any new content. Once you create something new, the grass is freshly cut and mowed down.</p>

Now there are 15 or so with permanent commit. How has this benefited the development of WordPress? In your opinion, is it possible to have too many people with core commit access? What advice can you give for those looking to either gain temporary or permanent access?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Jeff at <a href="http://wptavern.com/">WP Tavern</a> asked me these questions about a month ago, and while writing a reply, I realized it&#8217;d make a great¬†blog post. I&#8217;m going to answer these questions, but I also strongly believe you don&#8217;t need commit access (or even desire it) to be a great contributor who commands respect and influences the project. So perhaps the most important question I hope to answer here is this:¬†<strong>What are¬†qualities of a great contributor?</strong></p>
<p>A <em>committer</em> is a contributor with the ability to modify the main WordPress repository. If you&#8217;re used to a decentralized model, this would be those with push/write access. There have been around three dozen committers to WordPress over the last decade; <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/12/31/commit-announcements-for-3-9/">almost twenty</a> currently have access. But in 2009, there were just five.</p>
<p>The lead developers all got together for the first time at WordCamp Orlando in December 2009, right around the time I started contributing. (So no, I was not there.) At the time, there weren&#8217;t any committers who weren&#8217;t lead developers. They set a goal to expand the number of people. When they added <a href="http://dd32.id.au/">Dion Hulse</a> that January, Matt <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/01/12/dd32-whatcha-gonna-do/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the goals for the team in 2010 is to greatly expand the number of people with direct commit access, so the emphasis is more on review and collaboration. Right now commit access is tied up with being a ‚Äúlead developer,‚Äù of which we‚Äôve always found a small group of 3-5 works best, but now we want commit to be more a recognition of trust, quality, and most importantly activity, and something that can dynamically flow in and out as their level of commitment (har har) changes and decoupled from the ‚Äúlead dev‚Äù role.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great to empower and reward contributors with commit access. When Matt and I are together, he likes to challenge me with one particular thought experiment &#8212; he&#8217;ll ask what would happen if we just gave everyone the ability to push a change to WordPress. Obviously, that wouldn&#8217;t work. But at what point does it not work? 10? 50? 100? 1000? I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a raw minimum or maximum number. I think it has a lot to do with our <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/">philosophies</a> and <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/components/">how we organize ourselves</a>, for example.</p>
<h2>How to be a great contributor</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been involved in identifying and mentoring new committers for a few years now. Certainly, quality of contributions is important, but it&#8217;s only one small piece of the puzzle. Especially as contributors start to start review contributions by others, you start to see a number of other qualities. For example, what&#8217;s their judgment and temperament like? Also, you can have the most amazing judgment out there, but without strong communication skills, we&#8217;ll never know.</p>
<p>Attention to detail is extremely important. As a committer taking on the shared responsibility of maintaining a large, sprawling codebase, you need to always be thinking about edge cases, big ramifications of seemingly small changes, backwards compatibility, etc. We&#8217;re building something pretty amazing, but at a fifth of the internet, it&#8217;s also being run at such an incredible scale that all changes are risky. We&#8217;re very cognizant of this: once we hit a release candidate, every commit needs to first be reviewed by two lead developers, even if it&#8217;s a lead developer who authored it. It helps to be honest when, for example, you know you are <em>not</em>¬†confident. It&#8217;s important to be humble, which includes knowing when to ask for help, when you&#8217;re wrong, and when to change your mind. Along these lines, I like citing software developer <a href="http://ometer.com/features.html">Havoc Pennington</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the presence of good rationale, maintainers should be willing to change their mind often.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not about making mistakes, because we all make them. Being thorough and acutely perceptive just goes an incredibly long way to writing and reviewing code. (Word of the day: <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perspicacious">perspicacious</a>.)</p>
<p>We also take a lot of pride in building user-centric software. You don&#8217;t need to have amazing UX skills, but strongly believing in our <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/">core philosophies</a> goes a long way. These philosophies have roots in <a href="http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html">another of Pennington&#8217;s essays</a> on creating good user interfaces.</p>
<p>There is a lot of history embedded in the code, and we don&#8217;t make changes without a deep understanding of the code around it. So it&#8217;s important to want to <em>learn</em> it. You need to be curious and love to learn. At the same time, the more you work with a codebase, the more frustrated you&#8217;re bound to get with it, so you need to have a lot of patience. For years I&#8217;ve not only been building a mental map of WordPress in my head, but I&#8217;ve been overlaying it with a potential roadmap.</p>
<p>Patience when communicating with others can reveal a lot about temperament. Thousands of people represent the WordPress project in some way, so it&#8217;s important for contributors to lead by example. If a person feels he was treated poorly when he reported a bug, he&#8217;s not likely to contribute again. Karl Fogel covers an aspect of this in <a href="http://producingoss.com/en/committers.html#choosing-committers"><em>Producing Open Source Software</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes someone shows technical skill and an ability to work within the project&#8217;s formal guidelines, yet is also consistently belligerent or uncooperative in public forums. That&#8217;s a serious concern; if the person doesn&#8217;t seem to shape up over time, even in response to hints, then we won&#8217;t add him as a committer no matter how skilled he is. In a volunteer group, social skills, or the ability to &#8220;play well in the sandbox&#8221;, are as important as raw technical ability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Committers are essentially ambassadors of the WordPress project, so it&#8217;s important that¬†they lead by example.¬†It doesn&#8217;t serve the project to give a leadership role to someone who is often rude, cantankerous, or overly critical. Along the same lines, knowing how to actually handle a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q52kFL8zVoM">&#8220;poisonous person&#8221;</a> is helpful. It&#8217;s good to reach out to contributors to talk about this kind of behavior.</p>
<h2>How project priorities affect contributions</h2>
<p>So what advice can I give to those looking to become a committer? It probably isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d make a goal. I&#8217;d just work hard to make WordPress better. Regardless of your &#8220;access&#8221; you are sure to make an impact and receive respect from others.</p>
<p>I got my start doing a lot of thankless tasks during the 2.9 and 3.0 cycles. I tested the heck out of some of the newer features like trash, and weighed in and patched bugs. When multisite started to be merged in 3.0, I would sit there for hours dissecting it and seeing what I could do to understand it (and clean it up). I <a href="http://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&day=2010-02-04&sort=asc#m64323">volunteered for tasks</a>¬†no one else wanted to work on because I knew it was important to the project. I&#8217;d look out to see which tickets were being flagged for the current¬†release, then tackle¬†them, one by one. It was definitely noticed that¬†the committers could¬†reliably turn to me during crunch times¬†to get things done. Being responsive to the needs of the project¬†is key.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting you need to work on things you don&#8217;t enjoy. You can totally make¬†the project better while sticking¬†to an area of interest. You could even spend time in an area that overlaps significantly with¬†what you&#8217;re employed to do, if contributing isn&#8217;t¬†just a hobby for you. For example, <a href="http://scotty-t.com/">Scott Taylor</a> initially invested a lot of his time on making audio and video support better while he was at <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">emusic</a>¬†(though music is certainly also passion of his). A lot of contributors have stepped up to improve an API after digging deep into it for a project.</p>
<p>Worth mentioning: Discussing with your employer about contributing is not an easy conversation. While <em>hiring</em> based solely on open source contributions <a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community">can be fraught</a>,¬†companies that encourage their employees to contribute are helping themselves,¬†too. Contributing not only gives back or helps to establish a voice in the community, but but¬†it&#8217;s also an enriched learning environment. I learned more in my first three months contributing than I did in three previous years of¬†web development. It never¬†hurts to have a subject matter expert on staff. And if you&#8217;re a consultant, you&#8217;ll be worth more to your clients.</p>
<p>Many committers are &#8220;generalists&#8221; with a wide knowledge of WordPress, who have contributed extensively to all sorts of areas. Some are &#8220;specialists,&#8221; who work hard on a particular feature (perhaps a feature plugin), component (like multisite), or have a particular focus (like JavaScript). Becoming an expert in an area is hugely beneficial to the project.¬†Some of our more recent process changes mean we are trying to empower more people to help &#8220;maintain&#8221; these different areas. This is great because it means more contributors will be able to make bigger differences, whether it&#8217;s triaging new or old tickets, providing feedback, helping to build out a roadmap for a particular component, or mentoring newer contributors. Not everything is exciting (like digging through old tickets on Trac, as if looking for diamonds in the rough) but your contributions will definitely be noticed.</p>
<p>You may not see it right away when you start out as a contributor, but it&#8217;s important to place the project&#8217;s goals ahead of your own. You might have reported a dozen tickets and it&#8217;s possible you disagree with how ten of them were handled. You can and should¬†work¬†to fix tickets you reported, but at some point, you&#8217;ll hopefully run out of those and need to look elsewhere to get your fix. Many contributors &#8212; including every¬†committer &#8212; have &#8220;wish lists&#8221; or &#8220;pet projects&#8221; or &#8220;pet bugs&#8221; that they still haven&#8217;t gotten to, because they realize the project isn&#8217;t ready for them, or because their solution isn&#8217;t ready for the project, or because it simply isn&#8217;t a priority.</p>
<p>Some have said¬†contributing to WordPress is more politics than code.¬†I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true, but it can be¬†easy to think that when you¬†wonder¬†why some things are moving faster than some individual ticket (of thousands).¬†Scott Taylor recently wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>For a lot of people, I know the wait can be frustrating, but I would try¬†viewing it in a larger context: we all have things we would love to go in¬†immediately, but as responsible committers, we have to weigh the pros and¬†cons of tossing code onto 20% of internet. I have tickets that have been¬†open for 7 releases, but for each I either:</p>
<ol>
<li>don&#8217;t think the idea is fully-baked</li>
<li>don&#8217;t have absolute confidence that the feature/code is necessary</li>
<li>haven&#8217;t made a good enough case for it</li>
<li>haven&#8217;t provided bulletproof evidence that it&#8217;s going to make WP better</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>More from Havoc Pennington:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please don&#8217;t assume that the key issue for accepting a feature is whether there&#8217;s a patch. It isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s easy to write a patch. It&#8217;s hard to maintain a software project over the long term. Maintainers absolutely have to¬†<i>understand the rationale</i>¬†for each feature, not just rubber stamp the patches. If they don&#8217;t understand a feature they can&#8217;t maintain it over time. There will be future decisions about how the feature works, or how related features work, and the maintainer will have to make those decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is probably the least¬†understood reason why certain tickets move slower than others: maintaining things is hard. When something is¬†committed, that committer is taking on a lot of¬†extra responsibility. That bug or feature isn&#8217;t necessarily¬†the problem ‚Äî it&#8217;s also the bugs, features, and¬†even security issues that follow it. Our firm¬†commitment to backwards compatibility also means it will be harder to take a wrong turn now and correct it later. Very simply, there are a lot of things to work out.</p>
<p>What does describe WordPress well is that it&#8217;s more communication than code. I think this is also incredibly¬†healthy. Communication and collaboration are the lifeblood for an open source project.</p>
<p>As Matt cited in 2010, activity for committers is important, as you need to be following development discussions and an often fast-moving codebase. A lot of¬†contributors don&#8217;t venture beyond the bug tracker; you&#8217;ll want to pay close attention to the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">development blog</a>¬†and be active in IRC. Some of our committers have gotten less active over time, and that&#8217;s also okay, because we know we can trust their judgment. When they wish to commit something, <a href="http://producingoss.com/en/committers.html#dormant-committers">they&#8217;ll know they&#8217;re behind</a> and will first need to get caught up.</p>
<p>So ask yourself how¬†you want to contribute, and what kind of impact you want to have. Some of our best¬†contributors don&#8217;t have commit access, including a few who are significantly smarter than me. They either don&#8217;t want the responsibility of making decisions as a maintainer, or don&#8217;t have the time for it &#8212; and that&#8217;s totally okay!</p>
<h2>How the WordPress lead developers¬†choose¬†committers</h2>
<p>In the interest of transparency and¬†<a href="http://producingoss.com/en/committers.html">avoiding mystery</a>, let me¬†explain the specifics of the¬†decision-making process. For a few years now, we&#8217;ve been granting commit access for individual release cycles at first, on a temporary or &#8220;guest&#8221; basis.¬†It&#8217;s often¬†because they&#8217;re working on a particular feature, though it of course can double as a trial period. Sometimes a contributor is given commit access to a particular area or focus. (We use a <a href="http://producingoss.com/en/vc.html#vc-authz">relaxed approach</a>¬†for partial or &#8220;component&#8221; commit.)</p>
<p>The lead developers keep pretty close tabs on what&#8217;s going on, and¬†we always have people in mind for commit access. Typically, someone catches our eye and we&#8217;ll privately mention it to each other. This can happen very early on ‚Äî sometimes, someone&#8217;s first bug report or patch¬†just¬†knocks your socks off. If¬†you do good work, you will get noticed. A¬†potential committer¬†will often end up working on projects one-on-one with an existing committer. These projects end up being great opportunities to mentor that contributor, see what they&#8217;re interested in, get a feel for¬†how they think, and¬†so on.¬†We make it a point to request feedback from other core developers and guest committers, what they think of so-and-so.</p>
<p>The lead developers discuss commit access¬†over email before each release cycle. We&#8217;ll review current guest committers and proposed¬†new committers. We mention contributors¬†we&#8217;re keeping an eye on. Nothing is rigid about this process. There&#8217;s no formal &#8220;voting&#8221; procedures; there&#8217;s never been anything short of a consensus. A proposal can come at any time, not just at the start of a cycle (that&#8217;s just when we check in on¬†guest committers). A few times we&#8217;ve essentially agreed¬†ahead of time¬†to grant commit access once conditions are met. Some¬†examples: they&#8217;ll be ready in another month or two; we want a documentation committer, so let&#8217;s see who steps up after¬†we start this initiative; or let&#8217;s try to get the main developer of this feature plugin commit access if the merge goes well. (Building features as plugins first has¬†perhaps lessened the need for granting someone commit access for a cycle, but I think it&#8217;s too early to tell.)</p>
<p>Once a committer accepts, I usually go over a few guidelines. They go something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>For your first half-dozen commits or so, run them by me or another lead (either in IRC or privately) just while you get the hang of things.</li>
<li>The first sentence of your commit message gets used as the subject for the wp-svn mailing list. Add more details after that and don&#8217;t forget props or tickets.</li>
<li>Try to be on IRC when you&#8217;re committing; for the occasional instant feedback.</li>
<li>Aim to wait for some kind of consensus on the big or controversial stuff. Even Ryan and I, for example, rarely move on¬†anything hefty without the other glancing at it. On the other hand, don&#8217;t let us slow you down ‚Äî we are known bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Ryan and I miss things weekly and we have 12,000 commits between us.¬†Code can always be reverted. <a href="http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/">Peter</a> will revert you at least once; wear it as a badge of honor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, the final trigger¬†for commit access is <em>I&#8217;m getting tired of committing all of your¬†patches, because I never need to do anything to them.</em>¬†That&#8217;s what Ryan Boren told me on February 8, 2010, when he asked if I wanted commit, four years ago tomorrow. I&#8217;ve been really lucky to have had the pleasure of passing that sentiment¬†on.</p>

WPForce was created in 2011 as an outlet for Jonathan to share opinions and news with the WordPress community. Along with the acquisition, Joost shared details of the process he had to go through to transfer the site into his possession.</p>

<h3>This Isn&#8217;t The First Acquisition For Yoast</h3>
<p>This is the second WordPress community asset I&#8217;ve seen acquired by Joost De Valk. The first was <a title="http://wp-community.org/" href="http://wp-community.org/">WP-Community.org</a>, <a title="http://wptavern.com/good-luck-charles-stricklin" href="http://wptavern.com/good-luck-charles-stricklin">the previous home</a> of The WordPress Community podcast in 2009. At the time, Joost was producing a podcast called <a title="http://www2.webmasterradio.fm/press-this/" href="http://www2.webmasterradio.fm/press-this/">PressThis</a> with co-host Frederick Townes, author of the W3 Total Cache plugin. The two podcasts were merged but soon after, the podcast went silent.</p>
<h3>The Future Of WPForce</h3>
<p>Yoast states they will be toying with the old content of WPForce and the established business directory on the site. He hints that we&#8217;ll soon find out what their plans are. In a <a title="https://yoast.com/yoast-acquires-wpforce-com/#comment-193010" href="https://yoast.com/yoast-acquires-wpforce-com/#comment-193010">follow-up comment,</a> Yoast mentions the site will be a great testbed for upcoming themes they are developing.</p>
<p>Are there more WordPress site acquisitions in the future? In a comment published on the acquisition, Yoast said &#8220;<em>We‚Äôd be interested in buying just about <em>any</em> good WordPress site or product that fits into what we do</em>&#8220;.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Feb 2014 19:19:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The framework helps developers to quickly build things like fields for settings pages, widgets, custom post types, custom taxonomies and user profiles with minimal code.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="http://piklist.com/2014/02/04/new-piklist-new-piklist-com/" target="_blank">0.9.0 release</a> includes the ability to easily create your own list tables, add post-to-post relationships, group users by taxonomy and much more. Piklist now automatically creates and supports multiple user roles, a feature that WordPress currently supports without a UI.</p>
<h3>Piklist Plans to Add Commercial Plugins and Support Packages</h3>
<p>The project is maintained by two main contributors, Steve Bruner and Kevin Miller. I spoke to Bruner about Piklist rebranding. He said the new logo and site design are part of a new era and symbolize their mission for the future. &#8220;This year we plan on releasing other plugins that will be built on our framework,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Each Piklist plugin will connect, enhance and collaborate with other Piklist plugins.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Piklist&#8217;s continual improvement and plans to expand into plugins, it&#8217;s clear that this framework has found a solid user base. I asked Bruner if he thinks every WordPress developer needs a framework and why many of them are turning to Piklist. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">We believe that Piklist is to WordPress what Rails is to Ruby</span>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not every developer is going to use Piklist, but the ones who do are going to finish projects quicker and never look back. It simplifies many of the more difficult tasks in WordPress and adds functionality not presently common in WordPress core. <strong>Anything you can build with WordPress can be done in less time with Piklist.</strong> It&#8217;s that simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bruner and Miller have been supporting Piklist for the past two years without monetizing it in any way. The plan to release commercial plugins and support packages will help to fund the future of the framework. &#8220;We‚Äôve helped businesses achieve higher levels of productivity by using Piklist,&#8221; Bruner said. &#8220;Their donations have funded Piklist until now. We hope that our reputation for quality and ease-of-use will convince users that they can‚Äôt do with out Piklist, and the (soon-to-be-released) Piklist family of plugins.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Future of Piklist</h3>
<p>In the meantime, the team at Piklist is locking down features for the upcoming 1.0 version. Their next major release will be plugins based on the framework and they have more products in the pipeline that Bruner believes &#8220;will be as revolutionary as Piklist itself.&#8221; A drag-and-drop field and form builder is in the works. The team also plans to develop some out-of-the-box applications, such as a contact manager and order management.</p>

The changes are listed in two sections, <strong>required</strong> and <strong>recommended</strong>. The required changes would take effect immediately while those that are recommended could become guidelines in the future. Some of the recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bundled Plugins:</strong> Themes must not bundle Plugins.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrary Header/Footer Scripts:</strong> Themes must not provide Theme options for arbitrary header/footer scripts.</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> Themes are required to document in the Theme readme file the copyright/license attribution for all bundled resources.</li>
<li><strong>Theme Credit Links:</strong> ThemeURI and AuthorURI, if both are used, must be from distinctly separate sites.</li>

<p>On February 11th, 2014, internet users around the world plan to fight back in protest against mass surveillance. The setup is similar to the protest that was held in January 2012, which helped to defeat SOPA and PIPA censorship legislation. The February 11th event is called <a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/" target="_blank">The Day We Fight Back</a> and the mission is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Together we will push back against powers that seek to observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action. Together, we will make it clear that such behavior is not compatible with democratic governance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Websites can participate in the protest using the embeddable banner, which changes based on the the nationality of the visitors and includes different calls to action. Here&#8217;s what the banner looks like for visitors in the United States:</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tdwfb-banner.png" rel="prettyphoto[16452]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tdwfb-banner.png" alt="tdwfb-banner" width="1138" height="349" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16502" /></a></p>
<p>The banner makes it easy for your visitors to contact their legislators to ask that they oppose the<a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/sen-dianne-feinsteins-nsa-reforms-bad-privacy-bad" target="_blank"> FISA Improvements Act</a>, support the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/usa-freedom-act-real-spying-reform" target="_blank">USA Freedom Act</a>, and enact protections for non-Americans.</p>
<h3>WordPress Plugin For The Day We Fight Back</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re using WordPress and you want the banner on your site, there&#8217;s a plugin you can install to join the protest. Ryan Fugate&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/modemlooper/thedaywefightback.wp" target="_blank">The Day We Fight Back WordPress plugin</a> is based on <a href="https://github.com/tfrce/thedaywefightback.js" target="_blank">thedaywefightback.js</a>. It will automatically display the banner at midnight on 2/11 for 24 hours. If you want to display the banner now, there&#8217;s an option in the settings for that, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tdwfb-settings.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16452]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tdwfb-settings.jpg" alt="tdwfb-settings" width="769" height="335" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16506" /></a></p>
<p>When asked why he took the time to create the plugin, Fugate replied, &#8220;<strong>WordPress sites make up a large percentage of the internet and can have a powerful impact. Plugins make it easy to allow voices to be heard.&#8221;</strong> Check out a <a href="http://modemlooper.me/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of the banner in action on his site.

The originator of these requests goes by the username <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/profile/bestweblayout" target="_blank">bestweblayout</a> on WordPress.org and operates the <a href="http://bestweblayout.com/" target="_blank">bestweblayout.com</a> domain.</p>
<p>The issue was first <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-strange-offer-from-third-party-to-give-them-repository-access" target="_blank">reported</a> by WordPress user <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/profile/fractalizer" target="_blank">FractalizeR</a>, who posted the contents of the email:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hello Vladislav.</p>
<p>My name is Grigoriy and I am a representative of BestWebLayout. Our team specializes in WordPress development services.</p>
<p>We saw that your WP-SynHighlight plugin was updated more than 4 years ago. We would like to offer you our assistance and participation in further development and maintenance of this plugin. In other words, we would like to get your permission and access to plugin repository on wordpress.org. In such way we will become the plugin contributors along with you and will be able to control testing and development of this tool within the WordPress community.</p>
<p>Our activity will include plugin updates, compatibility testing, support, etc.</p>
<p>We have already talked to WordPress support team (they said that WordPress is open-source community and such contribution is welcome), who asked us to contact you with such a request. Please let me know if you are ready to accept our offer. Feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Grigoriy&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>FractalizeR&#8217;s initial reaction to the email was one of suspicion. &#8220;The offer itself is a little strange,&#8221; he said. <span class="pullquote alignleft">&#8220;If I want to contribute, I donate code. I don&#8217;t ask write access to the repository.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/profile/codix" target="_blank">@Codix</a>, another recipient of the email, decided to ask for contributions first. &#8220;I got the same offer and I suggested they should submit a patch to one issue before I can grant them access,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Still they insist they need to be listed as a contributor.&#8221;</p>
<p>A handful of other plugin developers reported on the same thread that they have received the same email, which they forwarded to plugins@wordpress.org. Mika Epstein, a member of the WordPress.org plugin review team, confirmed that they did not ask bestweblayout to get in touch with the authors.</p>
<p>In the meantime, bestweblayout <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-strange-offer-from-third-party-to-give-them-repository-access?replies=16#post-5173167" target="_blank">posted</a> on the thread in defense of the email solicitations:</p>
<blockquote><p>We aren&#8217;t involved in any illegal affairs. Earlier on forum there was a question about the possibility of cooperation with the authors of neglected plugins. And it said that it is not a problem to cooperate with the authors. So we decided to help WordPress community with these plugins. We only collect information about plugins, which were simply neglected by authors and have not been updated with the latest changes of WordPress. Some of the authors refused, but some of them agreed. Sorry that it looks like spam. </p></blockquote>
<p>Those who have reported having received the requests are uniformly suspicious of the technique that is being employed for gaining write access to their repositories. Epstein addressed bestweblayouts to explain why their requests are not being well-received. &#8220;It looks like spam because you&#8217;re sending this out to a LOT of people, and as of yet, haven&#8217;t done anything with the plugins,&#8221; she said. <span class="pullquote alignleft">&#8220;Which is, sadly, a tactic of some spammers. They&#8217;ll take over legit plugins and turn them into guideline violation spam fests.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>WordPress plugin developer Jeff Sayre was another recipient of the email and he <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-strange-offer-from-third-party-to-give-them-repository-access?replies=16#post-5201320" target="_blank">cites several issues with the approach</a> that indicate it may be a potential threat. The fact that anyone is free to fork a plugin and develop their own version was the first indication. Developers can let the original author know, as a courtesy, but permission is not required.</p>
<p>Secondly, the &#8220;approval&#8221; implied in the email request is suspect. &#8220;The fact that the email makes it appear that they have &#8220;approval&#8221; from the WP repo team to contact me is another big, red flag,&#8221; Sayre said. &#8220;No one requires approval from anyone at WP to contact a plugin author. I receive emails all the time about updating my plugins.&#8221;  Despite Epstein having made it clear that approval has not been given, the folks at bestweblayout continue to circulate the same email without modification.</p>
<h3>A Warning to All WordPress.org Plugin Authors</h3>
<p>Sayre has some sage words of warning to anyone who may receive this request or something similar. In case the offer of free updates to your plugin sounded like a dream come true to you, it&#8217;s a good idea to consider what is at stake. He cautions all concerned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Providing such credentials to an unknown, therefore untrusted party, is never wise as it could be a significant security threat. Malicious code could be entered into your plugin and you, in effect, would be complicit in its insertion. If you do not know someone, it is never wise to team up with them without fully vetting their integrity and the quality of their work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, you should be very wary of giving anyone write access to your plugin repositories. The motivation for the request could be harmless or it could be a ploy to gain access to WordPress.org plugins in order to unleash spamagaddon. When it comes to collaborating on code, it&#8217;s best to work only with developers you trust. If you&#8217;re not interested in collaborating, the safest route would be to suggest that they fork your work and credit you.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Feb 2014 21:16:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

This addition is part of Andrew Nacin&#8217;s most recent round of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/02/05/fine-grained-trac-notifications/" target="_blank">updates</a> for WordPress contributors. The greeting serves to introduce visitors to the development blog and weekly meetings, and also helps to quickly funnel bug filing and contributions to the appropriate screens.</p>
<h4>Simplified Ticket Form</h4>
<p>The ticket creation form has been simplified and cleaned up. The objective, according to Nacin, was to make the ticket creation process &#8220;much less intimidating.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/simplified-ticket-form.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16340]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/simplified-ticket-form.jpg" alt="simplified-ticket-form" width="747" height="431" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16448" /></a></p>
<h4>Fine-Grained WordPress Trac Notifications</h4>
<p>One of the most exciting additions is the new notifications preferences. Visit your <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/notifications/" target="_blank">trac notifications page</a> and you can now subscribe to activity that you&#8217;re interested in, based on component, focus or milestone. There&#8217;s also an option to subscribe to new tickets as they come in. However, in order to receive comments on the ticket you will need to star it.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/focuses.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16340]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/focuses.jpg" alt="focuses" width="729" height="635" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16455" /></a></p>
<p>These new notification preferences allow contributors to specialize in their areas of interest without being overwhelmed by irrelevant notifications. When you subscribe to a component, you&#8217;ll show up on that particular <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/02/05/fine-grained-trac-notifications/make.wordpress.org/core/components/" target="_blank">component page</a> as one of the contributors. This information may possibly make its way into WordPress.org profiles, as Nacin hinted in the comments, &#8220;And in the future, there‚Äôs no reason this can‚Äôt also be a part of your WP.org profile.&#8221;</p>
<p>This round of updates will be the last of the shiny new trac toys for awhile. Nacin says that he doesn&#8217;t have anything else planned at the moment. Thanks to his efforts, life is much easier for existing WordPress contributors and more inviting for those who are new to the table.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Feb 2014 19:30:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<h3>What BruteProtect Plans To Do With The Funding</h3>
<p>When I asked Sam Hotchkiss what he plans on doing with the funding, he told me that they want to hire additional personnel to focus on fulfilling the vision he has for the software. What once was a side project is now the main focus of a dedicated team. I found it surprising that something as simple as BruteProtect would be successful to the point of receiving venture capital funding. Sam however, was not surprised.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not at all surprised at the success we&#8217;ve had with BruteProtect so far. It&#8217;s a drop-dead simple to install plugin that provides the most comprehensive solution to the growing problem of distributed brute force attacks. It&#8217;s pretty incredible what a large problem this is. We&#8217;ve identified over 2 million infected machines that are a part of a distributed botnet and have blocked over 41 million attacks now. That number is growing by over 1 million a day on average at this point.</p></blockquote>
<h3>BruteProtect Is Just The Beginning</h3>
<p>BruteProtect is sort of like Akismet, but for the WordPress login page. It tracks failed logins across a large number of WordPress sites, then analyzes that data to find patterns and identify attack bots. The more sites using the service, the more data they have to work with. Sam believes that BruteProtect is just the tip of the iceberg. To that end, Jesse and Sam have created a new parent company called <strong><a href="http://GetParka.com" title="http://GetParka.com">Parka, LLC</a></strong> with the goal to allow websites to work together to solve problems.</p>
<h3>WordCamp Road Trip</h3>
<p>Sam and his wife have purchased a camper and will be traveling the United States of America stopping at numerous WordCamps along the way. Check out the license plate that will be on the bumper of their new camper.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WordCamperLicensePlate.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[15557]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15580" alt="WordCamp License Plate" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WordCamperLicensePlate.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a tentative list of upcoming WordCamps that Sam and his wife are planning to visit.</p>
<ul>
<li>March 1, 2014: WordCamp St. Louis</li>
<li>March 15, 2014: WordCamp Atlanta</li>
<li>April 10, 2014: Albuquerque WordPress Meetup</li>
<li>April 26-27, 2014:&nbsp;WordCamp Minneapolis</li>
<li>May 2-3, 2014:&nbsp;WordCamp North Canton</li>
<li>May 10, 2014:&nbsp;WordCamp Connecticut</li>
<li>May 17, 2014:&nbsp;WordCamp Charleston</li>
<li>May 30 ‚Äì June 1, 2014:&nbsp;WordCamp Asheville</li>
<li>June 13-15, 2014: WordCamp Chicago</li>

</ul>
<p>You can follow their adventure via <a title="http://wordcamper.com/" href="http://wordcamper.com/">WordCamper.com.</a> While the domain currently violates the WordCamp trademark, Sam says they are in the process of changing the domain and will redirect it to its new home.

Many of the trends on her list are carry overs from last year. Responsive is definitely not a trend but an expectation. Websites that are not responsive are at a serious disadvantage considering at least <a title="http://mashable.com/2013/08/20/mobile-web-traffic/" href="http://mashable.com/2013/08/20/mobile-web-traffic/">17.4% of web traffic comes through mobile</a> according to a study by <a title="http://www.statista.com/" href="http://www.statista.com/">Statista</a> in 2013.</p>
<h3>Fullscreen Background Images</h3>
<p>One particular trend that I don&#8217;t understand is full-screen background images and videos. Where are people finding gigantic videos and images to use with these themes? Granted, if designed properly with the right images, these types of sites look great. <a title="http://graphpaperpress.com/themes/wall-street/#demo-full" href="http://graphpaperpress.com/themes/wall-street/#demo-full">Wall Street</a> by Graph Paper Press is a great example of a design that looks good using fullscreen images. I&#8217;m just unsure of their practicality.</p>
<div id="attachment_16414" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WallStreetByGraphPaperPress.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16267]"><img class="size-full wp-image-16414" alt="Wall Street By Graph Paper Press" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WallStreetByGraphPaperPress.jpg" width="506" height="317" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wall Street By Graph Paper Press</p></div>
<h3>One Page Websites</h3>
<p>The other trend I&#8217;ve taken note of is one page sites. Instead of the typical site layout with links to informative pages, all of the pages are combined into one page. As you scroll, different pages of information are shown. Thanks to the simplified display of content, navigation can be determined with clever graphical elements instead of an entire column of links. I&#8217;m not a fan of this design but I realize not every website has to convey information in the same manner.</p>
<p>Amongst the trends listed on WPKube.com, which stand out to you? What <strong>new</strong> trends will we see in 2014? I&#8217;m predicting more WordPress themes in 2014 will take advantage of <a title="https://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/" href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/">icon fonts</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Feb 2014 17:15:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The gist of the post is that although <a title="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a simplified markup language that makes it easier to format and style content, it shouldn&#8217;t be forced onto users. In the post, Tom goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>To that end, I will¬†<em>always</em> advocate for markdown being a choice ‚Äì not a standard ‚Äì for people to draft their content, but I also believe that it‚Äôs important we not expect non-technical users to want to author their content in that way.</p></blockquote>
<p>When we wrote about <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-adds-support-for-markdown-is-tinymce-on-its-way-out" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-adds-support-for-markdown-is-tinymce-on-its-way-out">support for Markdown being added to WordPress.com</a> and then through Jetpack as a module, some questioned whether it would outright replace the TinyMCE editor in WordPress. The reviews were mixed but I&#8217;m glad to see TinyMCE isn&#8217;t going anywhere. In fact, WordPress 3.9 will have a <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-developers-take-note-tinymce-4-0-merged-into-core" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-developers-take-note-tinymce-4-0-merged-into-core">shiny new version of TinyMCE</a> for users to play with.</p>

<p>One thing I&#8217;ve enjoyed since we started using <a title="http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer" href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer">Stargazer</a> by Justin Tadlock is the visual editor. In Stargazer, Justin modified <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Editor_Style" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Editor_Style">editor-style.css</a> so that the content within the visual editor looks just like it would if it were published. It brings users closer to the principle of <strong>what you see is what you get</strong>. I bring this up because Tom drafts all of his posts in WordPress using the visual editor instead of using Markdown. He explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>As someone who enjoys writing, programming, and obviously markdown, I can also say that I‚Äôm someone who drafts all of his posts in the WYSIWYG editor of WordPress using editor-style.css because, when done right, it helps me to see clearly see what my content is going to look like when it‚Äôs published, and shortcuts save me just as much time as do syntax of markdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you Tom for advocating choice instead of forcing Markdown on users as the standard to formatting content.

This maintenance release includes two important security fixes related to group creation. It also adds a few improvements to WordPress menus integration, bp-default theme switching and theme compatibility.</p>
<p>Today is also the beginning of the <a href="http://buddypress.org/2014/02/buddypress-2-0-development/" target="_blank">BuddyPress 2.0 development</a> cycle. The plugin&#8217;s core contributors have finalized dates for beta 1 and the release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development starts (today): Wednesday, February 4, 2014</li>
<li>Beta 1 (8 weeks from today): Wednesday, March 26, 2014</li>
<li>Release (3 weeks after beta): Wednesday, April 16, 2014</li>
</ul>
<h3>What&#8217;s Coming in BuddyPress 2.0?</h3>
<p>Today&#8217;s BuddyPress development meeting focused on setting goals and exceptions for the 2.0 release. Here&#8217;s a quick overview of what you can expect to see in mid-April, barring any major roadblocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>bp-forums will be retiring</li>
<li>WordPress Rewrite Rules API integration</li>
<li>Move XProfile visibility from each field into Settings</li>
<li>last_activity usermeta improvements</li>
<li>Activity comment sync for comments</li>
<li>Ticket triage and general maintenance</li>
<li>BuddyPress Profile editing within the WordPress admin</li>
<li>New template pack</li>
</ul>
<p>The newest addition to this roadmap is the ability to <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-0-to-add-profile-editing-in-the-wordpress-admin" target="_blank">edit BuddyPress profiles directly within the admin</a>. Administrators will appreciate not having to navigate to the front end in order to view/edit profiles. Performance improvements are also a major focus in this release, as Boone Gorges is working on <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5349" target="_blank">refactoring the Activity query</a> and implementing persistent caching for the components.</p>
<p>The BuddyPress documentation team is <a href="http://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/the-codex-into-2014/" target="_blank">gearing up for another push</a> to expand codex articles and refactor the &#8220;Getting Started&#8221; section into a &#8220;User&#8217;s Manual.&#8221; Boone Gorges is also heading up an <a href="http://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2014/01/05/inline-documentation-initiative/" target="_blank">initiative</a> to improve BuddyPress&#8217; inline documentation coverage. If you can help document the plugin&#8217;s many action and filter hooks, please get in touch.</p>
<p>BuddyPress 2.0 is shaping up to be an exciting release. There&#8217;s a lot going on under the hood that will help the plugin perform better. Community management within the admin is on track for big improvements as well. What are you looking forward to in the upcoming 2.0 release?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Feb 2014 01:04:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

During the core development meeting today, the plugin was approved to be merged into the WordPress trunk. The days of editing widgets blind will soon be over, as widget editing with live previews will now be a native part of the WordPress publishing experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/widget-actions.png" rel="prettyphoto[16348]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/widget-actions.png" alt="widget-actions" width="1190" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15709" /></a></p>
<p>Weston Ruter, the project&#8217;s lead developer, submitted a detailed <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/28/widget-customizer-feature-as-plugin-merge-proposal/" target="_blank">proposal</a> on the new feature last week. After several rounds of feedback and testing, the feature needs only a few minor adjustments and a bit more polishing in the accessibility department before making its debut in WordPress 3.9.</p>
<h3>What Can You Do With The Widget Customizer?</h3>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t tested the plugin yet, prepare to be impressed. The widget customizer offers live previews for every action associated with widgets, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing existing widgets</li>
<li>Adding a new widget</li>
<li>Reordering widgets</li>
<li>Dragging widgets to other sidebars</li>
<li>Removing widgets entirely</li>
</ul>
<p>Widgets have long been one of the most user-friendly and approachable features in WordPress. The original WordPress widgets feature was actually first built as a plugin and then brought into core. When Matt Mullenweg first introduced widgets in <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2007/05/wordpress-22/" target="_blank">WordPress 2.2 (Getz)</a>, he described their purpose:</p>
<blockquote><p>WordPress Widgets allow you to easily rearrange and customize areas of your weblog (usually sidebars) with drag-and-drop simplicity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new widget customizer feature seems like a natural fit for the original intent to help users customize their sites more easily. Where would WordPress be without widgets? It&#8217;s safe to say that without this feature it would not be the CMS powerhouse that it is today. With live previews now on deck for every aspect of widget management, WordPress users will wonder how they ever lived without the widget customizer.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 22:58:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

This sent me into panic mode. I watched the animated circle spinning endlessly as if it were laughing at me. Not knowing what to do, I clicked a few buttons, including the Trash link but the damage had been done. The post was published and all it contained was a text link.</p>
<p>This is the second time I&#8217;ve been burned by the Publish button. Thanks to the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/publish-confirmation/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/publish-confirmation/">Publisher Confirmation plugin</a>, it will be the last.</p>

<p>Publisher Confirmation was created by <a title="http://profiles.wordpress.org/tristanh/" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/tristanh/">TristanH</a> and is simple to use. There are no configuration options. After the plugin is activated, when you click the Publish button, a dialogue box will open confirming if you&#8217;d like the post to be published or not. The plugin hasn&#8217;t been updated in 2 years so you&#8217;ll see a warning box on the plugin directory when searching for it. However, it works just fine with WordPress 3.8.</p>
<p>One update I&#8217;d like to see is a change in the wording from <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> to <strong>YES</strong> or <strong>NO</strong>. Ok and Cancel do not convert very well to Yes and No. Other than that, the plugin works exactly as intended and it&#8217;s already saved me once since activating it.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard the advice that you should delete old or unwanted plugins from your WordPress installation. Plugins are often on the forefront of WordPress housekeeping lists. This is probably due to the fact that on a normal WordPress site you&#8217;re usually running just one theme and then multiple, sometimes dozens, of plugins. Unused plugins in the mix make it inconvenient to scroll through the list and troubleshoot conflicts. They can also pose a security risk if they&#8217;re not updated.</p>
<p>But what about themes? Cleaning out your WordPress themes directory is just as important as plugin housekeeping. The current WordPress download package comes with three default themes pre-installed: Twenty Fourteen, Twenty Thirteen and Twenty Twelve. You may even have Twenty Eleven left over on your site, along with themes you&#8217;ve previously tested.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/800px-themes.png" rel="prettyphoto[16288]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/800px-themes.png" alt="800px-themes" width="800" height="548" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16297" /></a></p>
<p>Chances are that you won&#8217;t need all of these. Any theme not in use has got to go &#8211; with one important exception: a default theme for fallback. You can always re-install a theme further down the road if you decide you need it.</p>
<p>Trying on a bunch of themes and then leaving them in your themes directory is somewhat akin to leaving your clothes all over the floor, instead of putting them in the laundry bin. When it comes to WordPress themes, however, this careless practice can have some serious consequences.</p>
<h3>WordPress Themes Can Be An Entry Point For Hackers</h3>
<p>Because WordPress is now powering more than 1 in 5 websites on the internet, WordPress sites are a prime target for hackers and spammers. If your site isn&#8217;t secure, hackers can use your themes as entry points. They&#8217;ve studied WordPress themes and know how to take advantage of them to forge an all-out attack on your site, your server and its resources.</p>
<p>Hackers may insert malicious files or edits to your theme to try to hijack your site. Sometimes they get in through vulnerable scripts, as was the case with the historic <a href="http://markmaunder.com/2011/08/01/zero-day-vulnerability-in-many-wordpress-themes/" target="_blank">timthumb.php attack in 2011</a>, which posed a serious security risk for millions of WordPress sites using themes bundled with the script.</p>
<p>Once a hack is successful, you&#8217;ll spend more time than you&#8217;d like in unraveling what they&#8217;ve done and convincing your host to turn your site back on.</p>
<h3>WordPress Theme Housekeeping Checklist</h3>
<p>Outdated versions of WordPress, themes and plugins are the most common cause of hacked sites. At the very least, you&#8217;ll want to keep everything up to date. Enabling <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-to-configure-automatic-core-updates-for-wordpress-3-7" target="_blank">automatic background updates</a> is a great way to stay current, especially for sites that you own but rarely visit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a checklist of what you can do right now to clean out your WordPress themes directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all unused WordPress themes (with the exception of one default for fallback)</li>
<li>Update any themes that you are keeping</li>
<li>Make sure <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions" target="_blank">permissions</a> on your wp-content and themes directories are 0755</li>
<li>Enable automatic background updates</li>
</ul>
<p>This checklist should have you covered for the basics, but more advanced measures can be put in place if you&#8217;re keen on exploring additional security options.

What a busy week it&#8217;s been for the WordPress Plugin Repository! A lot of plugin developer &#8220;<em>New Years Resolutions</em>&#8221; are starting to bear fruit and are being released into the repository this week after a long month of development. We have a good sampling of fruit this week. Today it&#8217;s about <strong>Maps, Mobility, Menus, Money and Maintenance</strong>. Let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>
<h3>Overlay Multiple Location Markers on a Map as Custom Post Types</h3>
<p>For a few months I have been working on a business/industry directory site using a premium directory theme from ThemeForest and some custom programming. The theme worked well for about 6 weeks until suddenly it broke. The developer vanished off the face of the Earth. As my fellow theme buyers gathered with their pitchforks and torches, the entire theme was removed from ThemeForest due to lack of support. I&#8217;ve not been able to find the same functionality for maps <strong>until now</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot-31.png" rel="prettyphoto[16271]"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-16276" alt="gMap Point List" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot-31-300x188.png" width="300" height="188" /></a><strong><a title="gMap Point List" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/gmap-point-list/" target="_blank">Gmap Point List</a></strong> by Rafel Sans is a plugin that lets you create your own jQuery based map from the Google Maps API and then overlay your pins, or &#8220;<em>markers</em>&#8221; on top of the map. Each of the markers represents a custom post type that contains the data about the specific location. Because it is a custom post type, there is no limit to the data fields that are available when compiling data about a specific business listing. Pins can be added with address, lat/long Geo-coordinates or simply dropped on the map. The plugin is new and the documentation is currently only available in Spanish, but it was simple enough to use without it.</p>
<h3>How Much is a BitCoin Worth Anyway?</h3>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot-11.png" rel="prettyphoto[16271]"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-16281" alt="BitCoin Exchage Rate" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot-11.png" width="219" height="143" /></a>I&#8217;ve seen several BitCoin based plugins float by in the repository lately. There are several donation widgets that accept it, but I&#8217;m always resorting to a Google search to figure out exactly what my coins are worth. In comes the <a title="BitCoin Exchange Widget" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/btc-exchange-widget/" target="_blank"><strong>BTC Exchange Widget</strong></a>. This is a quick and easy widget that adds an area for visitors to enter the amount of BitCoins and select their preferred exchange currency, such as USD for US Dollars. In just one click, the current exchange rate is provided. While I am personally still a bit of a skeptic when it comes to BitCoin, fans of this virtual currency should find this plugin useful.</p>
<h3>Preview Your Posts as a Tablet or Mobile device in one click!</h3>
<p>Responsive design was supposed to make our lives easier. Instead of having to create a different mobile and tablet theme, the responsive set was billed as the end-all of design. While that advancement has certainly warranted applause, creating responsive content has not gotten much easier. This is mostly due to our inability to view our content as it would look on a device. Enter <a title="Responsive Post Preview" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-post-preview/" target="_blank"><strong>Responsive Post Preview</strong></a> by Jake Bresnehan. This plugin provides an easy, quick way to test how your content looks at various sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Have a look at the demo, straight from the developer.</strong></p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>
<p>This plugin will undoubtedly save a lot of time when in development mode. The instant view provided by Response Post Preview may be something that will find its way into WordPress Core functionality sooner than later.</p>
<h3>A clean, responsive way to show a site is still under construction.</h3>
<p>In the old days, we used an animated GIF of a construction tractor to show the world a site was not ready for public viewing. While that may have worked well in 2005, a domain today is considered a valuable web property. Every single site viewer should be seen as a potential lead or subscriber. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to provide as much information as possible on your &#8220;<em>Coming Soon</em>&#8221; page. Even though the site isn&#8217;t ready, you can still connect with your audience.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot-41.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16271]"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-16283" alt="Easy Maintenance Mode Coming Soon" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot-41-300x142.jpg" width="300" height="142" /></a>The <a title="Easy Maintenance Mode" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-maintenance-mode-coming-soon/"><strong>Easy Maintenance Mode</strong></a> plugin allows to you quickly create a maintenance or under construction page. Upon plugin activation you are presented with a few options to get you going, including Facebook, Twitter and Google+ connectivity options, HTML-enabled text area, customization of the background, fonts, colors and style. The plugin is also responsive, allowing you to provide the same message social connections across any platform. The great thing about this plugin is that a logged-in user does not see the &#8220;<em>Coming Soon</em>&#8221; screen. If you&#8217;re working on the site and are logged in, you will see the site as you normally would. But if you are a random page surfer or not logged in, you see the maintenance page.</p>
<h3>Adding Custom Icons to your Category Widget.</h3>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot-111.png" rel="prettyphoto[16271]"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-16285" alt="Category List Icons" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot-111-263x300.png" width="216" height="247" /></a>The recently released plugin <a title="Category List Icon" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/category-list-icon/" target="_blank"><strong>Category List Icon</strong></a> by Hasan Rang provides functionality to add an icon for your categories. I&#8217;ve often seen commercial sites that categorize their news with an icon. Now I can have it for myself, and so can you! The plugin provides options for custom category icon sizes and custom CSS for each of the category icon items. This can provide an added punch to a theme from a design perspective. The subtle, yet contextual icons can help your users identify content and navigate through your site accordingly. Page views matter to Google. Present your viewers with rich, content-related icons to navigate your site and you&#8217;ll be rewarded with a better looking sidebar category widget as well!</p>

Like the category icon plugin above, you can set up your own custom images and icons for the mobile menu. I found this among the easier mobile menu plugins that I have tested out. I can imagine the different button and icon configurations a person could come up with. But remember to stick with icons that will be familiar to your viewer. Keep it simple!</p>

The pillar sponsorship program is a package setup by WordCamp Central that enables businesses to sponsor multiple WordCamp events without having to go through the hassle of sponsoring them individually.</p>
<p>WordCamp organizers will have a little less to worry about when it comes to funding for their event. WiredTree has upped the ante and will be <a title="http://central.wordcamp.org/news/2014/01/31/wiredtree-sponsors-every-wordcamp-in-north-america-for-2014/" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/news/2014/01/31/wiredtree-sponsors-every-wordcamp-in-north-america-for-2014/">sponsoring all North American based WordCamps</a> in 2014. I got in touch with WiredTree and asked them why they became a pillar sponsor and if sponsoring WordCamps has led to more customers.</p>
<p>It turns out that the relationship between WordCamps and Wiredtree began at WordCamp Chicago 2013. A client of theirs reached out to Wiredtree on Twitter and asked if they would like to sponsor the event since they were a happy user of both. Zac Cogswell, President of WiredTree agreed that it would be a great fit.</p>
<blockquote><p>WordPress is the most widely deployed CMS system across our network and many of our clients are actively involved in the WordPress community. Our support team uses it daily so we have a lot of operational experience we can share. WordCamp in particular being non-profit and locally-organized looked like a great way to support the community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wiredtree had such a great experience sponsoring WordCamp Chicago, they later went on to sponsor WordCamp Grand Rapids, MI along with a few other events. Getting to connect with clients face-to-face has been invaluable to the company. I then asked Zac whether sponsoring WordCamps correlated with an increase in new customers:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s too early yet to say what the effect will be as we&#8217;re coming up on the second WordCamp of the year in Dayton, OH, but I can say that feedback on social media has been positive.

Did you know that you can set up notifications for topics on <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a>? Sign in to your account and then navigate to your notifications by visiting:</p>
<p><strong>http://profiles.wordpress.org/username/profile/notifications/</strong></p>
<p>Once you are there you can create new notifications by adding a search string for a topic that you&#8217;re interested in following. The &#8220;notification name&#8221; field will be shown in the subject line of the alert emails sent from WordPress.org.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/new-notification.png" rel="prettyphoto[16242]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/new-notification.png" alt="new-notification" width="1421" height="763" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16249" /></a></p>
<p>When you set up a new notification, you&#8217;ll be notified any time a word or phrase you choose are directly referenced in a post or forum anywhere in the WP.org ecosystem.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that mentions of your username are included in your notifications by default. Any custom notifications that you set up will be listed below your profile.</p>

<h3>Why Should You Set Up Email Alerts?</h3>
<p>Your profile on WordPress.org is more valuable than you might think. There are so many useful things you can do with the email alerts to keep you informed on community discussions without having to read everything. You can use your account to set up alerts for mentions of your own plugins, themes or topics that you are interested in following. If you are wanting to help out with support in the forums and have a particular area of expertise, you might consider adding it as a search string. If there are new features that you&#8217;re hoping will be added to core, you can use alerts to follow discussions on those topics.</p>
<p>Nobody has the time to read everything that happens on the WordPress.org ecosystem. Signing up for alerts is a strategic way to keep yourself in the conversation without having to dig for the references.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 05:38:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Moments is a new personal blogging theme that allows you to record your life with beautifully designed <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats" target="_blank">post formats</a>.

<p>Features included in the <a href="http://www.s5themes.com/theme/moments" target="_blank">Moments</a> theme are geared toward making it easy for you to personalize your site. A few of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widget ready sidebar</li>
<li>Support for all Post Formats</li>
<li>Custom Logo and Favicon support</li>
<li>Custom fonts via Google Webfont typography options</li>

<p>SIte5 offers the demo XML for download so that you can try the theme with the demo content in place. Moments, like all Site5 themes, comes with <a href="http://www.s5themes.com/documentation/moments/" target="_blank">excellent documentation</a>. As a hosting company, they probably understand the value of documentation in mitigating the number of support requests related to common problems. I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s also why they&#8217;ve built thumbnail regeneration into the theme, since that tends to be a frequent issue for users when activating new themes. Site5 also offers a <a href="http://www.s5themes.com/forums/discussion/moments/" target="_blank">support forum</a>, should you have any issues with the theme.</p>
<p>If you decide to use this theme, I would not recommend using the Stat Code option in the theme settings. It&#8217;s better to <a href="http://wptavern.com/why-you-should-never-add-analytics-code-to-your-wordpress-theme" target="_blank">put Google analytics or other tracking codes in a plugin</a> for data portability. When you change themes it&#8217;s too easy to forget that your tracking code was in the theme settings.</p>

Perhaps WordPress themes with well-designed post formats will inspire more users to learn how to use them in blogging. Moments does a nice job of spotlighting this feature.

WordPress.org is not yet suited to handle a large userbase of groups with varied interests. I call areas of the community where these groups congregate, <em>watering holes</em>. One example of such a place is Reddit.</p>
<h3>Casual WordPress News and Support</h3>
<p><a title="http://www.reddit.com/" href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit.com</a>, a popular news sharing website is more than just technology news. The site covers a number of topics called subreddits. One of those is <a title="http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress">dedicated to WordPress</a>. Over the past few months, I&#8217;ve noticed this is a popular hangout for WordPress developers and community members. I&#8217;ve seen everything from support questions answered to developers creating a plugin in their spare time because someone requested it. This watering hole is filled with helpful people. I&#8217;ve yet to see a WordPress thread filled with bashing or derogatory statements towards an individual.</p>
<h3>Advanced WordPress Topics</h3>
<div id="attachment_16201" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ProWordPressOnReddit.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16186]"><img class="size-large wp-image-16201" alt="Pro WordPress Subreddit" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ProWordPressOnReddit-500x196.jpg" width="500" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Advanced WordPress Topics On Reddit</p></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in more advanced WordPress topics, Brad Williams created a subreddit called <a title="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProWordPress/" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProWordPress/">ProWordPress</a>. The list is moderated by <strong>Brad Williams, Travis Northcutt, and Michael Beckwith</strong>. All three are respected members of the WordPress community. Please don&#8217;t submit WordPress support questions to this subreddit. Instead, use the <a title="http://wordpress.org/support/" href="http://wordpress.org/support/">WordPress.org support forum</a>.</p>
<p>I asked Brad why he created a separate WordPress subreddit instead of using the existing one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Because I wanted a smaller, focused subreddit for these advanced topics. Beginners won&#8217;t stumble into r/ProWordPress and if they do they will quickly realize it&#8217;s not the subreddit for them.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Does Using Reddit Equal More Traffic?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve rarely seen an increase in traffic due to Reddit with one exception. When Sarah Gooding published an article announcing <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-adopts-sass-css-preprocessor" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-adopts-sass-css-preprocessor">WordPress had adopted the Sass CSS Pre-processor</a> WPTavern experienced a large bump in traffic. There were over <a title="http://redd.it/1qo3bk" href="http://redd.it/1qo3bk">20 upvotes</a> on the WordPress subreddit along with a few comments. Because of the technical nature of the article and the technology focused users of Reddit the article did well. For the most part, content submitted to the site averages 1-5 upvotes amounting to very little traffic.</p>
<h3>Subreddits Are Like Forums</h3>
<p>Reddit is an enormous community of activity. Subreddits provide a place for like minded individuals to gather and discuss a particular subject without the crowd noise from the Reddit front page. I&#8217;ve never been a fan of Reddit but since I&#8217;ve discovered areas dedicated to WordPress, I&#8217;ve become an avid user. The thing I like most about subreddits is that they&#8217;re similar to forums. I love the community atmosphere of well run forums and I feel a similar vibe from the WordPress subreddit. If you&#8217;re going to participate on Reddit, I encourage you to read their <a title="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette" href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette">reddiquette page</a>. This document outlines how to stay within the good graces of the community.</p>
<h3>The Tavern As A Watering Hole</h3>
<p>My hope is when the WPTavern forums make their return, they will once again be a friendly watering hole where people can relax and talk WordPress. The community surrounding WPTavern is one of the primary reasons the site has been so successful.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a good place to hang out and talk WordPress, consider both WordPress subreddits. Just make sure to follow the rules and don&#8217;t even think about using Reddit for self-promotion.</p>

<p>A test environment for your WordPress site is an important part of being able to ensure smooth updates. It also allows you to test new plugins and themes without affecting visitors. However, creating an exact copy of your site in the same environment is no simple task. There are many commercial plugins and WordPress hosts who offer one click staging environments, but an easy-to-use free option has been somewhat elusive until now.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;d like to take you on a tour of the new <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/sandbox/" target="_blank">Sandbox</a> plugin, which is now available on WordPress.org. With just two clicks, this plugin creates an exact copy of your WordPress site on your existing hosting provider. The staging environment is completely independent of your site and is hidden from visitors and search engines. The Sandbox plugin also gives you the ability to create multiple sandboxes in order to test different iterations of your site and/or its extensions.</p>
<h3>How Sandbox Works</h3>
<p>I tested the plugin and can confirm that it does exactly what it says it will do. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sandbox copies your database tables into a new set of tables with a different prefix.</li>
<li>Data within the new database tables are updated to reflect the sandbox prefix</li>
<li>Sandbox copies all files a new folder under the sandbox directory.</li>
<li>The plugin updates the configuration file within the sandbox to support the unique sandbox database prefix</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick walkthrough of setting up Sandbox on a live site. Once you activate the plugin, a new Sandbox menu item is added to the admin where you can create your first test site. The plugin will warn you to backup your site before proceeding.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/add-new-sandbox.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16179]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/add-new-sandbox.jpg" alt="add-new-sandbox" width="822" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16190" /></a></p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to fill in the details for your test site. Simple enough, right?</p>

<p>The plugin gives you updates as it is creating your test site and will confirm its success at the end of the process. This may take a few minutes, depending on how large your site is.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/creating-sandbox.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16179]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/creating-sandbox.jpg" alt="creating-sandbox" width="485" height="232" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16197" /></a></p>
<p>Once you activate your new sandbox, you&#8217;ll be navigating your test site within your browser. An alert box at the top will let you know which site you&#8217;re on and there&#8217;s a link that takes you back to your live site at any time.</p>
<h3>Concerns and Feedback</h3>
<p>Sandbox is not a perfect plugin, by any means, but I think it&#8217;s an excellent starting place that could develop into a solution for setting up quick test environments. My chief concern, however, is that it&#8217;s difficult to know when you&#8217;re in the sandbox, despite the notice at the top. The URL doesn&#8217;t change and your test site is virtually indistinguishable from the production site. One improvement I&#8217;d suggest is a larger, more prominent notice that makes it clear which site you&#8217;re navigating.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you&#8217;re actively using the plugin, it will make your backups enormous, due to all the extra tables in your database. Each sandbox you add will add its own set of tables and this can really add up when testing multiple iterations of your site. The plugin does not remove the extra tables it created within your database when you deactivate and delete it. The good thing is that you can delete the extra tables be deleting your sandboxes when you have no further use for them.</p>
<p>I tested a small blog site and it seemed to take a little while to set up a sandbox. This is understandable, given how much work it is doing behind the scenes. However, I have little hope of the plugin working on larger sites without timing out.</p>
<p>What I love about Sandbox is that you don&#8217;t have to go through the process of copying files down to a local test environment that may not perfectly match your production server. I also appreciate the fact that it&#8217;s so easy to use and has a very low barrier for entry. WordPress users who otherwise might never explore a staging environment can easily handle the setup process of the Sandbox plugin.</p>

You know that if you break anything, it&#8217;s just sand after all. The Sandbox plugin makes it simple to test updates to your site&#8217;s plugins, themes and core. You can also use it to test plugin conflicts without turning off the lights on your production site. Simply create a new test site and go to town, disabling plugins one at a time. Testing conflicts wherein you are encouraged to disable all your plugins is much easier with a test environment that is an exact copy of your live site. The free <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/sandbox/" target="_blank">Sandbox</a> plugin makes it possible for WordPress users at any level to create their own staging environments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 04 Feb 2014 21:15:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Good news for BuddyPress fans: The project now has wallpapers available for desktop and mobile devices. While viewing the official <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/official-fonts-and-logos/" target="_blank">BuddyPress logos and fonts</a> page, I noticed that there were no wallpapers like those that you can find on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/logos/" target="_blank">WordPress Logos page</a>. I decided to reproduce a few of the wallpapers for BuddyPress, based on the backgrounds found on WordPress.org.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bpmobilewallpaper.png" rel="prettyphoto[16151]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bpmobilewallpaper-300x225.png" alt="bpmobilewallpaper" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16159" /></a>In the new BuddyPress Wallpapers section you&#8217;ll find a light background and a pale blue background with the following sizes available for each:</p>
<ul>
<li>640√ó960 Smartphones</li>
<li>1024√ó768</li>
<li>1440√ó900</li>
<li>2048√ó1536 iPad</li>
<li>2560√ó1400</li>
<li>2880√ó1800 for Retina display</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re excited to show your enthusiasm for BuddyPress, grab a wallpaper for your mobile home/lock screen, tablet or desktop. You can view the different colors and download the size appropriate to your device from the <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/official-fonts-and-logos/#buddypress-wallpapers" target="_blank">BuddyPress codex</a>.

Many cool new plugins have found their way into the repository in the last few days. Today we check out plugins for PayPal donations, Admin notes in individual posts, User Profile Links, User Profile Meta and a fun motivational plugin called WP Grass.</p>
<p>Remember to use a staging site if you choose to take these plugins for a test drive. Using brand new, untested plugins on a live site can have bad consequences. Make sure you create a backup before activating any of these plugins to a live site. You&#8217;ll be glad you did if things go bad. That being said, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>
<h3>Everything but the car in the yard on cinder blocks.</h3>
<div id="attachment_16120" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wp-grass2.png" rel="prettyphoto[16018]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-16120" alt="Infrequent Content = Overgrown grass!" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wp-grass2-300x187.png" width="300" height="187" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Infrequent Content = Overgrown grass!</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not difficult to spot the neighbor on your block that doesn&#8217;t take very good care of their lawn. With one glance, it&#8217;s quite clear who doesn&#8217;t maintain their property. <strong><a title="WP Grass" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-grass/" target="_blank">WP Grass</a></strong> uses the same &#8220;<strong>overgrown grass</strong>&#8221; concept to help motivate you to keep your home page filled with fresh content. When you frequently update the content on your site, the plugin shows a freshly cut lawn at the footer. The longer the time period between content, the higher the grass will get in the footer! This plugin is a good motivator that may help you to keep your blog properly maintained with fresh content.</p>
<h3>Grant someone a key without sacrificing the castle.</h3>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/user-profile-meta.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16018]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-16125 alignleft" alt="User Profile Meta" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/user-profile-meta-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a>There are many times in which I would like to grant an individual user specific capabilities on my site, but don&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of creating a new user role. <strong><a title="User Profile Meta" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/user-profile-meta/" target="_blank">User Profile Meta</a></strong> goes deep into the capabilities of a user without having to change their overall role. It allows you to edit existing user fields, create new fields, delete fields without having to refresh the page. Easily change common items like toolbar appearance, default editors and specific plugin access. Overall, I found this to be a very handy plugin to go into the finer details of a specific user.</p>
<h3>What about having too many fields on your User Profile page?</h3>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/profile-links.png" rel="prettyphoto[16018]"><img class="wp-image-16019 alignleft" alt="Profile Links" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/profile-links-300x219.png" width="300" height="219" /> </a><strong><a title="Profile Links" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/profile-links/" target="_blank">Profile Links</a></strong> provides easy to use functionality when it comes to the user profile page. If you&#8217;re like me and have a lot of different plugins that add to the user profile page, you know what a pain it can be to locate specific fields that need to be modified. Profile Links creates a quick jump list at the top of the user profile page for all of the different option groups in your profile.¬†This plugin is probably overkill to those who have only a few users. However, I found this to be a convenience in navigating through the user profile pages on some of my more largely populated sites with over 30 users.</p>
<h3>Leave a not-so-subtle note to your contributing users.</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/user-note.png" rel="prettyphoto[16018]"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-16127" alt="Admin Page Notes" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/user-note-300x279.png" width="300" height="279" /></a></strong>There are many plugins out there that allow the administrator to leave notes to a user. I&#8217;ve used everything from bbPress notification messages to sidebar notes, and nothing has had the capabilities of this plugin.<a title="Admin Page Notes" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-page-notes/" target="_blank"><strong> Admin Page Notes</strong></a> lets the admin leave an HTML capable note to the user within the post or page editor on an individual post basis. Call it a poor man&#8217;s <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/">Edit Flow</a>. For simple and effective placement of your message, this plugin is among the best I have seen. It works simply by adding a notation field in the post editor that only the administrator can see. No one but the administrator can edit or access the message. Because the area is also HTML capable, you are able to add research links or even further references to a story that your contributing user can use in their post.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s a great plugin if you take PayPal donations.</h3>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/paypal-donation.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16018]"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-16130" alt="PayPal Donation Plugin" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/paypal-donation-300x193.jpg" width="300" height="193" /></a>If you accept donations on your site, <strong><a title="PayPal Donation" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/paypal-donation/" target="_blank">PayPal Donation</a> </strong>may be a good solution. I found this to be more unique than other PayPal donation plugins. It has the ability to change images based on the current percentage of the funding goal. This would allow one to create a rising thermometer, a moving gauge or a scoreboard. Another unique trait found in this plugin is the feature of adding individual expenses. For an average blogger this could be items such as hosting and development expenses. It would also be an outstanding plugin for charities and specific goal fundraising. This is one worth test driving if you want a dynamic, changing display of your donation drive.</p>

<li>Why Mullenweg recently switched roles with Toni Schneider</li>
<li>Open communication and collaborative process for Automattic employees</li>
<li>Why Automattic uses trials for hiring</li>
<li>How company size impacts growth</li>
<li>Establishing company culture with remote workers</li>
</ul>
<p>One particular part that I found to be interesting was how Mullenweg had initially kept Automattic artificially small during the early days, for fear of losing the efficiency and excitement the company had developed. During the interview he says that he was surprised by how Automattic has been able to maintain the same culture while expanding to offer more prompt attention to every aspect of its products and support.  When discussing the organization&#8217;s growth, Mullenweg says,<strong> &#8220;Nothing great I&#8217;ve ever done has ever been alone. It&#8217;s always been with other people.&#8221;</strong> He offers an inside look at how Automattic is different, its unique hiring process and the preeminence of customer support.</p>

John O&#8217;Nolan, the project&#8217;s creator, originally <a href="http://john.onolan.org/project-ghost/" target="_blank">introduced</a> the idea of his pure blogging platform as a &#8220;WordPress-lite fork.&#8221; After a great deal of deliberation, O&#8217;Nolan <a href="http://wptavern.com/what-wordpress-can-learn-from-the-ghost-project" target="_blank">decided not to fork WordPress</a> and instead opted to built his application on Node.js, powered by the Express framework.</p>
<p>The Ghost tagline <em>&#8220;Just a Blogging Platform&#8221;</em> is essentially a reaction to WordPress&#8217; <em>&#8220;Just another WordPress site,&#8221;</em> and a departure from what O&#8217;Nolan perceived to be an increasingly CMS-focused WordPress core. After a successful round of funding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with more than $100,000 raised in the first 48 hours, Ghost was able to break out on its own. The project tapped into the growing demand for simplicity in blogging software. Ghost fans don&#8217;t want it to do everything; they simply want to publish blogs.</p>
<h2>Introducing Gust: A Ghost Style Publishing Admin For WordPress</h2>
<p>There were some in the WordPress camp who were disappointed that the project would not be continuing on as a fork, as Ghost would have been an appealing &#8220;flavor&#8221; of WordPress for users who don&#8217;t need a CMS. A few WordPress plugin developers were excited about some of Ghost concepts and have produced plugins that bring those into WordPress. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/gust/" target="_blank">Gust</a> is one in particular that caught my eye.</p>
<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/ideag/" target="_blank">Ar≈´nas Liuiza</a> has been slowly adding Ghost-style functionality to the Gust plugin ever since he released it on WordPress.org in mid-December of 2013. His objective for the plugin is to bring a Ghost-inspired, clean admin panel into WordPress for users who want to focus on blogging.</p>
<p>Gust re-imagines the WordPress admin panel to feature posts.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gust-dashboard.png" rel="prettyphoto[16038]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gust-dashboard.png" alt="gust-dashboard" width="1358" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16057" /></a></p>
<p>The plugin adds markdown, a word count and live previews to the WordPress post editor. If the viewport is too small to display both panels, the live preview is then tabbed:</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gust-post-editor.png" rel="prettyphoto[16038]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gust-post-editor.png" alt="gust-post-editor" width="1358" height="653" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16065" /></a></p>
<p>The new post tagging interface is one of the recent additions to the plugin. Its unobtrusive place at the bottom of the screen keeps the focus on content creation in the main part of the viewport.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tagging-interface.png" rel="prettyphoto[16038]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tagging-interface.png" alt="tagging-interface" width="466" height="247" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16071" /></a></p>
<p>The post settings at the bottom of the editor allow you to easily edit the time published, post slug and delete, if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gust-delete.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16038]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gust-delete.jpg" alt="gust-delete" width="1096" height="586" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16072" /></a></p>
<p>The Gust plugin also adds a themed login page that sports a Ghost-inspired design:</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gust-login.png" rel="prettyphoto[16038]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gust-login.png" alt="gust-login" width="855" height="335" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16068" /></a></p>
<p>Gust is an unofficial port of Ghost features to WordPress, which is why it adopted the slightly modified name. Its capabilities currently include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts/Pages Markdown editor</li>
<li>Media upload integration</li>
<li>Post tags support</li>
<li>Post category support</li>
<li>Post scheduling support</li>
<li>Themed login page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes on Testing Gust</h3>
<p>Gust requires PHP 5.3 or higher. After you install the plugin, it may seem like it&#8217;s not working. That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s not yet an intuitive way to take users to the Gust admin panel. You get there by visiting: <strong>yourdomain.com/gust</strong>. Adding a button to the admin area to launch the Gust editing panel would help to make the plugin easier to use. However, once inside the Gust panel, I found the current features easy to use and free from major bugs.</p>
<p>Liusiza plans to add a category manager in the upcoming 0.4 version of the plugin. He cautions that this is an early release, so some features, such as categories and support for featured images, are not yet present. If Gust is able to gain enough interest, he will add these features in a future release.</p>
<p>I would like to see Gust presented with a more unique design that isn&#8217;t a wholesale copy of the Ghost editor, but that&#8217;s a matter of preference, not function. Overall, I like what Ar≈´nas Liuiza has done with <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/gust/" target="_blank">Gust</a>. If he continues to further develop and support it, the plugin will no doubt become a solid option for streamlining the WordPress admin for bloggers.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 03 Feb 2014 20:55:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The site is powered by <a href="http://headwaythemes.com/">Headway</a>, <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms</a>, <a href="http://wp-types.com/">Toolset</a> and <a title="http://www.wordpress.org" href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. To report an act of kindness, visit <a title="http://wpkindness.com/submit-an-act-of-kindness/" href="http://wpkindness.com/submit-an-act-of-kindness/">their submission page</a> and fill out the necessary details. Near the end of the submission form is a radio button where users can sign up to an infrequent newsletter. I asked the sites creator Ryan Bell what information would in the newsletter: &#8220;<em>I would send out a newsletter once or twice a month with my favorite submissions</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPKindnesslogo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[16043]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16049" alt="WP Kindness Logo" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPKindnesslogo.jpg" width="542" height="140" /></a></p>
<p>The site is a great idea but things become fuzzy once you read <a title="http://wpkindness.com/terms-of-service/" href="http://wpkindness.com/terms-of-service/">their terms of service</a>. The only problem I see is with number three &#8220;<em>You understand wpkindness.com might use an affiliate link to the company you are submitting about.</em>&#8220;. I am torn on whether this is good or bad.</p>
<p>The way I see it, an affiliate link within an act of kindness report is almost the same as a great product review. Visitors that come across these links may make purchases based on those reports. If I report an act of kindness, I&#8217;m not sure I like the idea of someone else making money off my report. I have to admit, it&#8217;s an ingenious way of generating affiliate income if he can get a lot of people to submit acts of kindness that have occurred with companies. Ryan tells me that although there are no affiliate links on the site now, he wanted to cover his bases in case he wanted to use them to monetize the site in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would probably only do it for products I have used and feel are great products. If the site starts to be used a lot by the community and is an asset I don&#8217;t see why I shouldn&#8217;t be able to find a way to monetize it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on the receiving end of many acts of kindness but I&#8217;ve mostly used Twitter, forums, or a blog post to thank them. I appreciate Ryan&#8217;s goal for the site.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is always someone willing to help you figure out how to make your site do what you want it to do with WordPress. I wanted to give those people recognition, whether it is a theme shop, hosting platform, plugin developer, or just a human who loves WordPress. My desire is for this to be a place where people can come and brag about the awesome people in the WordPress community and in turn build loyalty for that brand.</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see how many people share acts of kindness they have received from members of the WordPress community. It&#8217;s a great idea but the possible use of affiliate links on reports makes me uncomfortable. I&#8217;m not against Ryan making money, but I don&#8217;t think adding affiliate links into submitted content is the right way to go about it. I&#8217;d have a blog attached to the site and create content that correlates with the submissions. Then use affiliate links within those posts.</p>
<h3>Help Ryan Out:</h3>
<p>Ryan is seeking recommendations from the community on what they would like to see on the site. Also, if you have any ideas on how Ryan could monetize WPKindness without manipulating submissions, let us know in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 03 Feb 2014 20:33:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Between WooThemes and WooCommerce, I think they have enough customers to sell out any venue for a conference focused on their products.</p>

<p>I was able to locate WordPress on the map along with Jetpack, bbPress, Captcha, NextGen, WooCommerce, Akismet, and Mike Little. I don&#8217;t care whether the map is accurate or not. I just think it&#8217;s cool to see so many websites and technology companies represented in this fashion.

Nick is the creator of the Aesop <a href="http://aesopstories.com/story-engine/" title="http://aesopstories.com/story-engine/">Storytelling Engine</a>. We talked about the news of the week. Then, we launched into a great interview with Nick where he tells us what inspired him to create Aesop, how he got involved with WordPress, and what his plans are for the service now that it <a href="http://wptavern.com/aesop-wordpress-storytelling-plugin-is-now-fully-funded" title="http://wptavern.com/aesop-wordpress-storytelling-plugin-is-now-fully-funded">successfully completed</a> its crowd funding campaign. </p>
<p>Marcus and I as well as the chatroom discussed potential use cases for Aesop that go above and beyond telling a story. For instance, the idea of using it to create a text-based game with images that can have multiple endings. Listen to the show and let us know in the comments what ideas you have for Aesop!</p>

The new Markdown module in <a href="http://jetpack.me/2014/01/31/jetpack-2-8-introducing-markdown-and-improving-monitor/" target="_blank">Jetpack 2.8</a> gives you the option to write and edit rich text without having to write code or reach for your mouse. If you&#8217;re not familiar with Markdown, here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/markdown.png" rel="prettyphoto[15930]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/markdown.png" alt="markdown" width="600" height="287" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15980" /></a></p>
<p>That transforms on the front end to look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/markdown-example.png" rel="prettyphoto[15930]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/markdown-example.png" alt="markdown-example" width="600" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15985" /></a></p>
<p>Markdown fans will also be glad to know that this feature works on mobile, so you can continue using Markdown when blogging on the go. </p>
<p>The Markdown module in Jetpack also includes all the same features available on WordPress.com, which allows fenced code blocks, inspired by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown" target="_blank">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>. This produces code blocks within your content, nicely formatted to the language you specify. Jetpack users may even be able to do away with their syntax highlighting plugins in favor of using the new Markdown module.</p>
<h3>Publicize Adds Support For Custom Post Types</h3>
<p>The other major new feature in Jetpack 2.8 is the expansion of the Publicize module to support custom post types. This should be a relief for users who often publish new entries as a custom post type. Now you can automatically share those new posts to your social networks with one small tweak to the CPT‚Äôs &#8216;supports&#8217; array. The Jetpack team demonstrates the following example to enable the title, editor, Publicize and Markdown: </p>
<pre>'supports' => array( 'title', 'editor', 'publicize', 'wpcom-markdown' ),</pre>
<h3>Improvements to Monitor Module</h3>
<p>Lastly, Jetpack&#8217;s Monitor module now includes the ability for you to add multiple email addresses for notifications of downtime on your site. This is very helpful for sites that have multiple people available to offer support. With more people getting the notices, you&#8217;re much more likely to to be able to tackle your downtime issues in a timely manner.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 22:23:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p></p>
<p>Matt Mullenweg has a history of acquiring great domains. In 2009 <a title="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/shorten/" href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/shorten/">he announced </a>he had obtained the only two letter .me domain in the world which is used as a URL shortener. The domain for his personal site is <a title="http://ma.tt/" href="http://ma.tt/">ma.tt</a>. Single letter domains are rare, highly valued, and expensive.</p>
<h3>Project94</h3>
<p><a title="http://www.project94.org/" href="http://www.project94.org/">Project94.org</a> is the allocation of 94 1-2 character .ORG domain names that have never been released for registration. Through GoDaddy and eNom, these names are made available to registrants who not only reflect the core attributes of the .ORG domain but also reinforce the trust and value of the .ORG brand. Their <a title="http://www.project94.org/about-project94/" href="http://www.project94.org/about-project94/">about page</a> has more information but the allocation of 1-2 character domains have been reserved since 1985 when .ORG was created.</p>
<h3>The Purpose Of W.org</h3>
<p>I confirmed with a source inside of GoDaddy that they are the ones who provided Matt the domain. Details concerning the transaction are private and the <a title="http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=w.org" href="http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=w.org">WHOIS information</a> shows no affiliation with Matt.</p>
<p><a title="http://w.org" href="http://w.org">W.org</a> currently redirects to WordPress.org but is also used to host images and other static assets. I got in touch with Otto to see what the domain and sub-domains are being used for.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://s.w.org">s.w.org</a> is where we&#8217;re serving static resources for the main website from. Things like images and CSS files and other such things that don&#8217;t go through PHP processes. If you examine the source of most any page on WordPress.org, you&#8217;ll see it uses <a href="http://s.w.org">s.w.org</a> for a lot (not all, yet) of the static files displayed.</li>
<li><a href="http://ps.w.org">ps.w.org</a> is for the plugin repository. We can use it for screenshots and the header banners and other images from the plugin system.</li>
<li><a href="http://ts.w.org">ts.w.org</a> is for the theme repository. Same deal, for theme screenshots and the like.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using a CDN or Content Distribution Network, serving images and other static assets is much faster. This also reduces the load on the various servers that make up WordPress.org. The sub-domains are part of an ongoing effort to make the entire WordPress.org website capable of running over HTTPS. According to Otto, the new CDN supports HTTPS while the previous one did not.</p>
<p>While Matt owns a lot of coveted domains, he has yet to obtain <a title="http://ww1.wp.org/" href="http://ww1.wp.org/">WP.org</a> which is currently just a parked domain.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 18:11:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sat, 08 Feb 2014 07:00:21 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"207755";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sat, 08 Feb 2014 06:45:22 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20140124061426";}}
