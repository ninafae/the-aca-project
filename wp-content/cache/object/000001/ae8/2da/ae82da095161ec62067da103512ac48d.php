These days, itâ€™s hard to keep track of who does and doesnâ€™t have access. In fact, some developers are getting temporary access for release cycles to work on specific features. I remember in 2010, community member DD32 or Dion Hulse was granted core commit access. When Dion Hulse was hired by Automattic, the move generated discussions on whether or not it was ok for Automattic to have so many employees with core commit access versus those with no affiliation with the company. Fast forward four years later and the subject appears to have been a moot point. On the last day of 2013, Andrew Nacin outlined the number of people with permanent access to commit code to the core of WordPress as well as those who have received temporary access. It now takes three hands to count all of the people who have the permanent ability to commit code. Hereâ€™s a full list of those with permanent commit: @markjaquith, @ryan, @westi, @matt, @azaozz, @dd32, @koopersmith, @duck_, @helen, and me (@nacin); @lancewillett for bundled themes; @iammattthomas for UI. You might have also seen commits before from @josephscott (XML-RPC), @nbachiyski (internationalization), and @mdawaffe (secret weapon for really tricky problems). Itâ€™s great to see so many talented people involved with the core of the project. It would be awesome to see more companies like 10up find a way to sponsor an employee to work on WordPress full-time. However, you donâ€™t need to be employed to make a huge, positive impact on the project. Qualities Of A Great Contributor If youâ€™re interested in becoming a core contributor, Andrew Nacin has published a fantastic post that looks at the qualities of a great WordPress contributor. The post is making the rounds throughout the community and some have called it required reading.'>WPTavern: Trend: More People Getting Commit Access To The Core of WordPress</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://wptavern.com/aquarius-a-free-responsive-wordpress-theme-for-personal-bloggers?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=aquarius-a-free-responsive-wordpress-theme-for-personal-bloggers' title='Aquarius is a new free theme in the WordPress Themes Directory. The typography features the Georgia font and the home page is geared toward personal bloggers. The single post design focuses on the content with post meta data displayed unobtrusively at the bottom of the page. In addition to being fully responsive, Aquarius has two other mobile-friendly features. The slide-out sidebar is hidden from view but can be pulled out when needed. Also, its sticky top menu (fixed navigation) helps mobile visitors move around the site after scrolling far down the page.  Aquarius is a theme that was created to highlight blog content and as such does not include an host of confusing options for customization. It does, however, pack in all the basics one might look for in a modern WordPress blogging theme, including:  Responsive and retina-ready Supports all built-in post formats with basic styling Two widgetized areas â€“ sidebar and footer Fixed navigation Custom navigation overlay pattern Clean Georgia-based typography Very easy to use â€“ no theme options  Check out a live demo to see Aquarius in action with some sample content. This is the first theme created by the individual behind wplovin.com. He/she plans to expand the collection throughout 2014, as stated on the themeâ€™s homepage: â€œSo, Iâ€™ve challenged myself to handcraft twelve free WordPress themes in 2014. Thatâ€™s one awesome theme per month.â€ The planned themes will be â€œnewbie-friendly,â€ easy to use and will follow WordPressâ€™ standard theme development practices.  Itâ€™s an interesting concept and weâ€™ll be watching the site to see how it unfolds. You can check it out on github if youâ€™d like to contribute.

We dived into a number of topics including:  Using ThemeForest as a launch platform The reputation of ThemeForest Can theme authors profit while coding themes the right way How theme authors can differentiate themselves without having every theme option available  This is a fantastic discussion that I encourage everyone to listen to. Iâ€™d especially like to hear feedback from other sellers on ThemeForest. Marcus Couch helped us wrap up the show by providing his three plugin picks of the week. Stories Discussed: Would You Attend A WooCamp? WiredTree To Sponsor All North American WordCamps In 2014 Widget Customizer Approved For WordPress 3.9 BuddyPress 2.0 Development Kicks Off, Release Set for Mid-April Plugins Picked By Marcus: WP Like System is a rating system for WordPress posts, based on Facebook likes. Allow users like (and undo) your blog posts. A userâ€™s likes are saved directly on your database, like a WordPress native component, which means users can give you a â€œlikeâ€ without a Facebook account. This would be great to change the â€œlikeâ€ term to something else, and use an alternative icon instead of the thumbs up. Overall a good plugin. Responsive Post Preview has functionality that I envision being a part of WordPress core someday. It allows you to preview a post as it would look on multiple devices. Choose mobile or tablet device size for your preview. This plugin makes it so much easier to format your responsive content to make certain that everything lines up the way you want it to. WP Grass â€“ The grass grows higher and higher on the footer when you have not published any new content. Once you create something new, the grass is freshly cut and mowed down.
