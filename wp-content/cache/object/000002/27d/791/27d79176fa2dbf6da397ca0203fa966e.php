<h3>...Where true craftsmanship is bred right here in our salons!</h3>
&nbsp;
Pet grooming is a $50 billion industry, and growing. In addition to that, the world of pet grooming is a world of entrepreneurship -- groomers are usually self-employed and have to worry about arranging booth space, marketing, client scheduling, and more. A Cut Above's premiere Pet Grooming Apprenticeship Program prepares apprentices with a competitive advantage beyond the knowledge of proper technique: We provide our apprentices with the opportunity and resources to start growing their business right from day one! With our program, you will enter this competitive industry armed with the business skills you need to truly succeed in today's economy.
&nbsp;
A Cut Above sets the bar high for skilled, caring professionals in the pet grooming industry. Our rigorous program ensures you will get the individual attention and experience you need to meet our high groomer standards. This gives you a unique edge because during the apprenticeship program, you will work side-by-side and gain the opportunity to start your own grooming business right from day one! We will help you achieve the skills you need to adapt to any pet's grooming needs, from sensitive nails to unique breed cuts. We will help you get access to top-of-the-line resources for marketing, business management, and more.
&nbsp;
A Cut Above's Pet Grooming Apprenticeship Program is designed to teach the fundamentals of pet grooming using classroom-style lectures by professionals in their respective fields (dog training, successful shop ownership, clipper repair & maintenance, etc.) The program includes teaching hands-on techniques, and arranges for internship agreements with a variety of pet grooming shops (in-home and store-front). As an apprentice in our program, you will learn how to groom pets with safe handling techniques. You will also have the opportunity to be paid for work in a professional pet grooming salon environment.
&nbsp;
Our 12-week program consists of classroom and hands-on instruction, including supervised/supported practice time. You will receive a certificate of completion once you've finished your hours, and all apprentices who complete the program are welcome to come back to classes for unlimited learning hours -- this feature of our apprenticeship program represents thousands of dollars in training, as well as a unique, powerful tool in your favor that can help you continue to stay up-to-date on your knowledge and skillset!
